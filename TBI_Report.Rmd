## Research Questions 

1. What is the distribution of TBI severity (mild, moderate, severe, penetrating) in different branches of the military? 
2.	What is the annual trend in the number of deaths due to different injury mechanisms causing traumatic brain injury? 
3.	What are the primary causes of traumatic brain injury (TBI)? And how do they affect different age groups?

## Data Description

The analysis uses three datasets:

1.	**tbi_age.csv**: This dataset provides information about Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) cases categorized by age groups. The data is estimated for the year 2014. 
    + age_group: The age group of the TBI patients.
    + type: The type of measure used in the dataset.
    + injury_mechanism: The cause or mechanism of the injury.
    + number_est: The estimated number of observed cases in 2014.
    + rate_est: The estimated rate of TBI cases per 100,000 people in 2014.

2.	**tbi_year.csv**: This dataset provides information about TBI cases over different years.
    + injury_mechanism: The cause or mechanism of the injury.
    + type: The type of measure used in the dataset.
    + year: The year of observation.
    + rate_est: The estimated rate of TBI cases per 100,000 people in the year of observation.
    + number_est: The estimated number of observed cases in each year.
    
3.	**tbi_military.csv**: This dataset provides information about TBI cases in different branches and components of the military.
    + service: The branch of the military where the TBI case was reported.
    + component: The component of the military where the TBI case was reported (active, guard, reserve).
    + severity: The severity or type of TBI.
    + diagnosed: The number of diagnosed TBI cases.
    + year: The year of observation.

## Data Interpretation

### RQ1:	What is the distribution of TBI severity (mild, moderate, severe, penetrating) in different branches of the military?

```{r figname1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig.1 Distribution of TBI severity (mild, moderate, severe, penetrating) in different branches of the military.", fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("traumatic-brain-injury_1.png")
```

* The distribution of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) severity varies across different branches of the military, and it differs between Active, Guard, and Reserve components. In the Active component, the Army reported the highest number of TBI cases across all severity levels. Most cases were mild, with 94,447 cases, followed by moderate (9,274), penetrating (1,795), and severe cases (1,232). The Navy, Air Force, and Marines also reported high numbers of mild TBI cases, but fewer moderate, severe, and penetrating cases.

* In the Guard component, the Army again reported the highest number of cases across all severities, with the majority being mild cases (21,271). The Air Force reported fewer cases, but the distribution across severities was similar to that in the Army, with mild cases being the most common.

* In the Reserve component, the Army again had the highest number of cases. The number of mild cases in the Marines and the Navy was also significant. As with the other components, mild cases were most common, followed by moderate, severe, and penetrating cases.

* Overall, these findings suggest that mild TBI is the most common type of injury across all branches of the military and components. However, the number of moderate, severe, and penetrating injuries should not be overlooked, as these injuries can have significant impacts on service members' health and well-being.

### RQ2: What is the annual trend in the number of deaths due to different injury mechanisms causing traumatic brain injury?   

```{r figname2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig.2 Estimate the observed cases of deaths by injury mechanism each year.", fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("traumatic-brain-injury_2.png")
```

* The total number of deaths due to different injury mechanisms causing Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has shown varying trends over the years. From 2006 to 2014, several injury mechanisms have displayed notable trends. Deaths due to Motor Vehicle Crashes, once the leading cause of TBI-related deaths in 2006 with 16,260 cases, have shown a consistent decline over the years, dropping to 10,656 cases by 2014. Intentional self-harm, on the other hand, has been on the rise, increasing from 14,292 cases in 2006 to 18,485 cases in 2014. Unintentional falls also showed a steady increase, from 10,952 cases in 2006 to 15,939 cases in 2014.

* However, deaths due to Assault have seen a gradual decrease over the years, with the number of cases dropping from 6,051 in 2006 to 4,906 in 2014. Deaths due to being unintentionally struck by or against an object have remained relatively stable and low over the years, ranging from 371 cases in 2006 to 378 cases in 2014. Deaths due to other unspecified mechanisms have fluctuated with no discernable trend. The number of cases due to other unspecified mechanisms was 2,172 in 2006 and slightly increased to 2,547 in 2014.

* These trends suggest that while some causes of TBI-related deaths have decreased over the years, others have increased, indicating a shift in the primary causes of TBI fatalities.

### RQ3: What are the primary causes of traumatic brain injury (TBI)? And how do they affect different age groups?

```{r figname3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig.3 Distribution of primary causes of traumatic brain injury with the different age groups.", fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("traumatic-brain-injury_3.png")
```

* The United States recorded 2.87 million cases of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in 2014. The data is grouped into two types of TBI: lethal (2% of cases) and non-lethal (98% of cases). The mechanisms of injury include intentional self-harm, assault, motor vehicle crashes, unintentional falls, being unintentionally struck by an object, and other/unknown mechanisms.

* The data suggests that the lethality and cause of TBIs vary by age and whether the injury is fatal or not. Unintentional falls are a frequent cause of non-lethal TBIs, but their lethality increases with age. Intentional self-harm is a particularly troubling cause of lethal TBIs, alongside motor vehicle crashes. Assaults also contribute to the TBI fatality rate but to a lesser extent. Interestingly, while being unintentionally struck by an object is a common reason for emergency room visits, it's less likely to result in a fatal outcome.

* Overall, the data emphasizes the importance of preventive measures tailored to specific age groups and causes, such as fall prevention for the elderly and young children, violence reduction for young adults, and safe driving interventions for young drivers.

## Conclusion

* In summary, Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) are a significant concern across the U.S. military and the general population, with varying severity across different military branches and components. Mild TBIs are most common, but moderate, severe, and penetrating injuries also occur, impacting health and well-being significantly. The Army consistently reports the highest number of TBI cases, indicating a high-risk environment that requires targeted prevention and treatment strategies.

* In the broader U.S. population, TBI mechanisms and outcomes vary by age and injury severity. Unintentional falls and intentional self-harm are leading causes of TBIs, with their impact varying by age and lethality. While motor vehicle crash-related TBI deaths have declined, they remain a considerable concern. These findings highlight the need for targeted TBI prevention and treatment interventions, considering specific risks associated with different age groups, military branches, and injury causes.
